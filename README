California Coastal HABs ML Project

Project Goal:

Develop and compare machine learning and physics-augmented models to forecast coastal chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and harmful algal bloom (HAB) events along the California coast using multi-decadal satellite and reanalysis datasets.

Hypothesis:

H3 – Physics-augmented loss curbs spatial spread error: Imposing advection-diffusion residuals (winds + currents) in the loss will reduce down-coast displacement and false bloom area compared to purely data-driven spatiotemporal models.

Comprehensive List of Steps:

Data Acquisition & Overview
• Obtain MODIS Level-3 8-day composite chlorophyll-a data (2003–mid-2021) at ~4 km resolution, clipped to a coastal stripe (lat × lon = 240 × 240).
• Acquire ancillary reanalysis variables: Kd_490, nflh, precipitation, shortwave radiation, 10 m winds (u10, v10), 2 m temperature (t2m, d2m), salinity (so), ocean currents (uo, vo), sea surface height (zos), wind stress curl (curl_uv), and distance-to-river metric.

Data Audit & Harmonization (T0)
• Load NetCDF files with xarray; apply coastal mask and generate QC flags.
• Convert time units, ensure consistent physical units, and verify NaN-free coverage within stripe.
• Compute monthly climatologies and anomalies for all variables.

Feature Engineering & Stratification
• Derive features: rolling means & standard deviations (8-, 24-, 40-day), lagged drivers (1–3 steps), wind stress components, Ekman upwelling index, current speed & vorticity, SSH gradient magnitude, river influence rank.
• Target engineering: compute linear chlorophyll (chl_lin = exp(log_chl) – floor) and retain log_chl as regression target; define bloom intensity tiers based on pooled seasonal quantile distribution (<50%, 50–75%, 75–95%, >95%).

Spatiotemporal Split Design
• Temporal blocking: Train (2003–2015), Validation (2016–2018), Test (2019–2021); optional sliding k-fold windows.
• Spatial blocking: Cluster coastal cells into ~5 latitudinal bands or k-means on (lat, lon); leave one band out per spatial fold.
• Combined stratified folds: Cartesian product of temporal × spatial blocks; maintain class balance across bloom tiers.
• Define production splits: STRICT_OOS (latest years + northern band), TEMP_ONLY, SPACE_ONLY.

Baseline & Tabular ML Models
• Naïve baselines: persistence (ŷ(t+1)=y(t)), monthly climatology, linear/ridge regression.
• Tabular models: XGBoost and LightGBM on pixelwise feature vectors; compute SHAP feature importances.

Deep Spatiotemporal Models (T1–T2)
• ConvLSTM v0: single-scale nowcast (0-lead) and short-lead (8-day) forecast; benchmark skill and baseline attribution.
• ConvLSTM v1+: add multi-scale attention, residual connections, multi-lead seq2seq training.
• Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT): flatten coastal stripe to pixel sequence or patch embeddings; multi-horizon probabilistic outputs with gating and variable selection.

Physics-Augmented & Hybrid Models (T4)
• Embed advection–diffusion PDE residuals (winds, currents, learned κ) into training loss (PINN framework).
• Enforce no-flux boundary conditions; compare spread fidelity vs. data-only models.

Driver Ablation & Transfer Skill (T5)
• Remove groups of drivers (atmospheric, oceanic, riverine) to assess individual contributions.
• Test transfer skill by training/validation across sub-regions (north ↔ south).

Event Detection & Classification (T3)
• Convert continuous Chl forecasts to categorical bloom tiers; evaluate hit/miss rates, probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI).

Evaluation Metrics & Diagnostics
• Global metrics: RMSE, MAE, Bias, Pearson r, Spearman ρ, NSE, KGE in log and linear space.
• Stratified metrics: RMSE by Chl tier, monthly RMSE curves.
• Spatial diagnostics: skill maps (RMSE & % improvement), mean & bias maps, RMSE by latitude bands.
• Temporal diagnostics: domain-mean time series, lead-time skill curves, ROC curves for bloom thresholds.
• Additional analyses: Taylor diagrams of monthly anomalies, hexbin scatter (obs vs pred), error boxplots by observed quartiles, Hovmöller diagrams, case-study snapshot maps.

Figure Package for Manuscript
• Study region & data sources map
• Data flow diagram
• Chlorophyll distribution CDF with strata thresholds
• Blocked CV schematic
• Skill comparison barplots (baselines, ML, hybrid)
• SHAP variable importance charts
• Reliability/calibration curves for probabilistic outputs
• Case study maps for major bloom events (e.g., 2015 warm blob, 2016 El Niño)

Reproducibility & Data Management
• Versioned data freeze (v1.0) with SHA hashes
• Conda environment YAML with exact package versions
• Metadata JSON (variable names, units, fill values, strata edges)
• Train/Val/Test index files and fold definitions
• Model checkpoints and configuration files
• End-to-end reproducible pipeline script (Makefile or Snakemake)

Computational Considerations
• Chunked data loading with Dask; mixed precision training
• Batch sampling strategies: patch mode vs stripe-flatten mode
• Class-balanced queue for rare-event sampling

Risk Mitigation & Future Extensions
• Address data gaps: track valid coverage and drop low-coverage frames
• Handle floor bias: censor modeling or mask low-level signals
• Plan extensions: super-resolution downscaling, multi-sensor fusion, species-specific risk layers, operational dashboard

Novelty:

Embedding a simplified 2-D advection-diffusion PDE into the model’s loss function (a PINN-style hybrid) to force the network to honor realistic transport physics, then comparing its spatial‐forecast skill against purely data-driven ConvLSTM/TFT approaches.
